This repository is just to learn GraphQL concepts from youtube channel - Ben Awad that I follow

## Notes:
#### Commands
* Run the project using ```yarn run``` command
* Use ```psql``` to start to manage postgres database
* Use ```\c <databasename>``` to connect to the database
* Perform queries using psql Commands
* Use ```\q``` to disconnect from database
*

## Tools/libraries
* ```yarn add merge-graphql-schemas``` from [GitHub OSS Project](https://github.com/okgrow/merge-graphql-schemas) is used to split types in schema file into small files. This helps with growing project/complex projects.
